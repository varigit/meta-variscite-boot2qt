To successfully set up the Boot to Qt software stack,

2. Installing Boot to Qt on Target Device

To flash the image, you can use either Toradex Easy Installer
(https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-easy-installer#) or Qt's Flashing Wizard.


2.1 Flashing with Toradex Easy Installer:

When Toradex Easy Installer is connected to the Internet, it automatically provides
the latest Boot to Qt image in its image list but that is not necessarily compatible
with your Boot to Qt installation. When you flash with Toradex Easy Installer,
you should always use the *.tezi.tar package that is included into the Boot to Qt
installation.

Flash the Boot to Qt image with Toradex Easy Installer as follows:

1. If your target device does not have the pre-installed Toradex Easy Installer,
follow instructions in https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-easy-installer#load-toradex-easy-installer#
to load Toradex Easy Installer.
2. Your Boot to Qt installation has the *.tezi.tar package under
<Qt installation directory>/<Qt version>/Boot2Qt/<target>/images. Extract the package
to an SD card or a USB flash drive.
3. Flash the image from the SD card or the USB flash drive with Toradex Easy Installer.
See https://developer.toradex.com/software/toradex-easy-installer#installing-the-images.


2.2 Flashing with Qt's Flashing Wizard

1. Use the RS-232 cable to access the serial terminal on Toradex board.
2. Power on your device and press any key to stop the autoboot.
3. Run the following command in U-Boot:

ums 0 mmc 0

4. Connect your device to the development host using USB On-The-Go (OTG).
5. Use Flashing Wizard to flash the image to the device:
   5.1 Launch Qt Creator.
   5.2 Select Tools > Flash Boot to Qt Device, and follow the instructions in Flashing Wizard.
6. Press Ctrl+C in the U-Boot console and run the reset command.

Note: The u-boot is not updated when using the Flashing Wizard.
